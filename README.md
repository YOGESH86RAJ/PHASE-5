This README file provides instructions on how to run the AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System code and lists the dependencies required for the project.

# Overview

The AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health-related features. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions, and you can input your own data to get predictions for specific individuals.

# Dependencies

Before you can run the code, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Flask (for the web application, if applicable)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided example notebook)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bashCopy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System:

Clone the repository:
bashCopy code
git clone https://github.com/YOGESH86RAJ/diabetes-prediction-system.git
cd diabetes-prediction-system

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed as mentioned above.
Place your dataset in the project directory. The dataset should be a CSV file with columns containing relevant health-related features. If you don't have a dataset, you can use the example dataset provided.
Run the prediction code:
bashCopy code
python predict_diabetes.py -i your_dataset.csv -o predictions.csv

Replace your_dataset.csv with the name of your dataset and predictions.csv with the desired output filename.

# Using the Web Application (Optional)

If you want to use the web application to make predictions, follow these additional steps:

Install Flask:
bashCopy code
pip install flask

Run the Flask web application:
bashCopy code
python app.py

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the web interface for making predictions.
Example Notebook
An example Jupyter Notebook is provided in the project directory, demonstrating how to load the model and make predictions using sample data. You can open it using Jupyter Notebook:

# bashCopy code

jupyter notebook example.ipynb

# Introduction

This repository contains code for an AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System. This system uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. This README provides detailed instructions on how to run the code and lists the dependencies required for the project.

# Dependencies
Before you can run the code, you need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bashCopy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bashCopy code
git clone https://github.com/YOGESH86RAJ/diabetes-prediction-system.git
cd diabetes-prediction-system

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed as mentioned above.
Prepare your dataset. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the relevant health-related features as columns. If you don't have a dataset, you can use the example dataset provided in the repository.
Run the prediction script with your dataset:
bashCopy code
python predict_diabetes.py -i your_dataset.csv -o predictions.csv

Replace your_dataset.csv with the name of your dataset and predictions.csv with the desired output filename for the predictions.

# Example Dataset
An example dataset (example_dataset.csv) is provided in the project directory. You can use this dataset to test the prediction script.

# Prediction Results
The prediction script will generate a CSV file (e.g., predictions.csv) with the predicted outcomes for each entry in your dataset. The predictions will be in the form of binary values (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes).

# Customization
You can customize the machine learning model used for prediction by modifying the predict_diabetes.py script. You can replace the model with your own or fine-tune the existing model.

# Contributing
